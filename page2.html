<h1 id="main-header">Where am I from?</h1>
<p>I was born in St louis Missouri on june 28. My mom at the time was an accountant and my dad was a sales manager for a company that makes and sells electrical equipment.
<br>I remember when I was little my family would go to cardinals games at the old Busch stadium with its ring of arches around the upper part of the stadium. If I remember correctly we sat in the mid level area behind third base as my dad had season tickets and would sell the tickets to the games we didn't go to for extra money.
<br>My mom and dad would often take me and my brother to one or two football games a year and during the years that mizzou was really good they would bring us to most games.</p>

<p>When I was five I began attending kindergarten at the parkway school district and I stayed with parkway all the way through high school. I remember even in kindergarten I had a keen interest in computers</p>
<h3>my first job</h3>
<p>When I was old enough I began working as a lifeguard at <b>Aquaport</b> in maryland heights. I think I was sixteen then.
    <br>I worked for the management company that ran Aquaport for several years. Last summer was my final summer there becuase I am staying on campus to do research.</p>
