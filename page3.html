<h1>Going to mizzou.</h1>
<body>
<p>I began my time at mizzou as a mechanical engineering major. My first semester at mizzou was not very remarkable because of covid and reslife making mine and many others lives miserable.<br> pretty much the only thing that I enjoyed during my freshman years first semester was when we managed to defeat LSU in football. after that game ended
    a lot of campus started acting like things were back to normal for the rest of that day. after the game that day I went to a party on east campus and had the time of my life. the next day things were back to normal</p>
<p>at the beginning of my softemore year things started off pretty good. I was worried about my chemistry though because I had heard horror stories from people who had taken the class before. <br>
it turned out they were not lying. That class combined with calculus 2 ultimately made me decide to change my major. Originally I was planning to switch it to accounting. I ultimately made the decision to do information technology.<br>
as soon as I had made that decision I knew I wanted to do research with spot so I emailed the professor in charge of the lab and heard back a while later.</p>

<h4>Working with spot</h4>
<p>I will never forget my first time getting to work with Spot. <br> I was invited to help Professor Culmer take spot to the mizzou game against florida. I met him at his lab and we loaded spot into a Pelican case. and then loaded it into professor Culmers car.
Once we got to the game he trained me how to use spot right by big MO. While he was teaching me how to use spot, Drew Lock walks up and the announcer begins to introduce him and have him hit BIG MO.  </p>
